# PRODIGY_ML_03

This repository holds the project for the third machine learning task of the Prodigy InfoTech internship.

## Execution Environment

This project was developed and executed entirely on a local computer. The scripts are designed to be run in a standard Python environment.

## Project Structure

-   `/input`: Contains the dataset required for the analysis and model training.
-   `/src`: Contains the source code, typically in the form of Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies needed to run the project.

## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/VerindraHernandaPutra/PRODIGY_ML_2.git](https://github.com/VerindraHernandaPutra/PRODIGY_ML_2.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd PRODIGY_ML_2
    ```
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Run the main script or notebook** from the `src` folder to see the implementation.
